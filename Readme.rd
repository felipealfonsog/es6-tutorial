Arrow functions work like normal method expressions in JavaScript, but with a shorter syntax. They also have the added benefit of being anonymous. In addition, unlike normal JavaScript function, they do not bind the this object to their function scope.
The map helper method in es6 allows us to create arrays by calling a function on each element of an initial array.
The filter helper method in es6 creates new arrays with all the same elements of an initial array depending on a test that we give it.
